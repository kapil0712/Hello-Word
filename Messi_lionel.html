He plays for FC Barcelona and the Argentina national team. He has                won FIFA world player of the year four times (a record already). He has often been described                as Diego Maradona’s successor because of his prolific goal scoring record and ability to dribble past opponents.                “I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentine                football and his name is Messi. Messi is a genius, and he can become an even better player.”               <br> "His potential is limitless, and I think he’s got everything it takes to become                Argentina’s greatest player."                <br>                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona">-Diego Maradona</a>        <h3>Short Biogrsphy Lioel Messi--</h3>        <p>            Lionel Messi was born, 24 June 1987, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario,_Santa_Fe">Rosario</a> , Argentina to a working-class family.            His father was a factory steel worker, and his mother a cleaner.            He began playing from an early age, and his talent was soon apparent.            However, at the age of 11, Messi was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).            This was a condition that stunted growth and required expensive medical treatment, including the use of            the drug Human growth hormone.            His local club, River Plate were interested in signing Messi but didn’t want to pay for his medical treatment.            However, Messi was given a trial with Barcelona, and coach Carles Rexach was impressed –            offering Messi a contract (written on a paper napkin!) which included paying for Messi’s            treatment in Spain. Messi moved to Barcelona with his father and became part of the prestigious FC Barcelona youth academy.        </p>        <p>            “I made a lot of sacrifices by leaving Argentina, leaving my family to start a new life.            But everything I did, I did for football, to achieve my dream. That’s why I didn’t go out partying,            or do a lot of other things.”           <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi"> – Lionel Messi</a>        </p>        <p>        Messi progressed through the ranks and was given his first appearance in the 2004/05 season becoming the youngest player        to score a league goal. In 2006, Messi was part of the double winning team which won both La Liga (Spanish League) and        Champions League. By next season, (2006-07) aged just 20, Messi was the first choice striker and an essential part of the        Barcelona team – scoring 14 goals in 26 league games.        In the 2009-10 season, Messi scored 47 goals in all competitions,        equalling Ronaldo’s record total for Barcelona. As the seasons have progressed, Messi kept improving and        breaking his own records. In the calendar year of 2012, he broke the all-time world record for most goals scored in a        calendar year. His final total of goals in 2012 was 91 – beating the previous record of 85 by German Gerd Muller,        and Pele’s milestone of 75 in 1958.        </p>        <p>            “My record stood for 40 years – 85 goals in a year – and now the best player in the world has broken it,            and I’m delighted for him. He is an incredible player, gigantic.”            <br><a href="">– Gerd Muller</a>        </p>            <p>                At the start of 2013, in club football, Messi has scored 292 goals from a total of 359 appearances,                and in international football, 31 goals from 76 appearances.                At the end of 2012, Messi turned down a very lucrative offer to play for an unnamed Russian side.                It would have given Messi a salary of €20 million a year and made Messi the most expensive player                in the world (Barcelona would have been paid €250 million). He turned down the offer because he was unsure                if he would be playing in major European championships and the difficulties in moving to Russia. Instead,                he signed a contract with Barcelona until the end of 2018. When asked about moving to the English Premier League,                Messi revealed his sense of commitment to Barcelona.            </p>            <p>                “Barcelona is my life. They have brought me to where I am today. I could not leave,                I don’t want to leave. I know the Premier League is very good. But I cannot see myself                playing in England because my heart is with Barcelona, always.”                    <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi"> – Lionel Messi</a>            </p>    </div>    <div id="International Career">        <h2>                International Career        </h2>        <table>            <tr>                <td>                    <img src="Messi_image/international.jpg" width="500" height="300">                </td>                <td>                    <img src="Messi_image/internatinal2.jpg" width="500" height="300">                </td>            </tr>        </table>        <p>            Because Messi was brought up in Spain, since he was 11 years old, he has Spanish nationality.            In 2004, he was offered the chance to play for Spain’s Under 20 side, but Messi decided to play for Argentina,            the country of his birth. He led Argentina to victory in the 2005 FIFA Youth Championship. Messi made his full            international debut in August 2005, during a friendly against Hungary. In his first game, Messi was sent off for            allegedly elbowing a player. The decision was contentious and not in keeping with Messi’s style of play which is            generally clean and in the spirit of fair play; he has very rarely been accused of diving.        </p>            <p>                In 2006, he participated in the World Cup, becoming Argentina’s youngest player to play in the world cup.                Argentina were eliminated in the quarter-finals. In 2008, he won an Olympic gold medal for Argentina in football                at the Beijing Olympics. Initially, Barcelona had not allowed him permission to play, but new coach                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola"> Pep Guardiola</a>                allowed him time off.            </p>            <p>                In the 2010 World Cup, Messi wore the number 10 shirt and played well to help Argentina reach the quarter-finals,                but Messi struggled to score, and Argentina disappointingly lost 4-0 to Germany in the quarter-final. Messi has                admitted he is desperate to play in a world cup final. Success for Messi in the World Cup would be the last test                of greatness. Pele, by contrast, was part of Brazil’s three times winning World Cup side ’58, ’62 and ’70.            </p>            <P>                Messi is widely regarded as one of the most exciting players of the modern age – in fact, any age.                He has a peerless ability to dribble and take on opponents. Maradona has described his ball control as                supremely good. “The ball stays glued to his foot; I’ve seen great players in my career, but I’ve never seen                anyone with Messi’s ball control.” Messi has said he wishes to retain the joy of how a child plays football.            </P>            <p>                “I have changed nothing, my style of play is still that of a child. I know that above all it is my job                and that I should approach it in another way, but one must not lose sight of the fact that football is a                game. It is imperative one plays to amuse oneself, to be happy. That is what children do and I do the                same thing.”                <br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi"">– Lionel Messi</a>            </p>            <p>                After winning the Ballon d’Or for the fourth time in January 2013, Messi said:            </p>            <p>                “To tell you the truth this is really quite unbelievable.

In the opening game against, Bosnia – Herzegovina, Messi scored a great goal to give                    Argentina a winning start. He scored four goals to help Argentina reach the World Cup Final. In the                    final, Argentina lost 1-0 to Germany. Messi was awarded ‘Golden Ball’ player of the tournament,                    though the decision was not universally supported.
